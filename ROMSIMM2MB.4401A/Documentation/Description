The GW4401A 64-pin ROM SIMM replaces the 
ROM SIMM of a Macintosh II-series or 
Macintosh SE/30 computer. GW4401A comes 
preprogrammed with a customized, 32-bit clean 
Macintosh ROM. The customized ROM allows your 
Macintosh to use more than 8MB of RAM, 
and also features a 1.5MB bootable ROM disk 
preloaded with System 7.0 and several utilities.
